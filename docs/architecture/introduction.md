# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **AI Habit Tracker**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** This is a greenfield project with specific technology choices already made. No starter template is mentioned, but the Expo + Supabase combination is a modern, well-supported fullstack approach.

**Rationale:** The Expo + Supabase combination provides rapid development capabilities with built-in authentication, real-time database features, and Edge Functions for serverless backend logic. This aligns well with your mobile-first approach and the AI integration requirements described in the PRD.

  - [ ] Test service layer auth filtering and error handling

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.6-1.9: Supabase Auth service fully implemented with useAuth hook providing user session state. Authentication screens (LoginScreen, SignUpScreen, PasswordReset) successfully integrated. Navigation structure established with AuthStack, OnboardingStack, and MainTabs. Auth context provides user state across the app but route protection not yet implemented.

### Data Models
User data security utilizes established authentication and database structures [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
- **profiles table**: RLS policies already defined for user profile data isolation
- **goals table**: RLS policies configured with user_id filtering via auth.uid()
- **weekly_stages table**: RLS policies use EXISTS clause checking goal ownership through user_id
- **habit_logs table**: RLS policies filter by user_id matching auth.uid()
- **recalibrations table**: RLS policies check goal ownership via goal_id → user_id relationship

### Authentication Service Integration
Route protection uses existing authentication infrastructure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]:
- **useAuth hook**: Already implemented in Story 1.6, provides user, session, and isLoading states
- **Supabase Auth**: Session persistence with AsyncStorage, automatic token refresh
- **Auth Context**: Global auth state management across navigation stacks
- **Session Management**: Automatic session restoration on app launch

### Component Specifications
**Protected Route Component** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]:
- **Location**: `app/src/navigation/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (new component)
- **Pattern**: Wrapper component that checks auth state before rendering children
- **Dependencies**: useAuth hook, React Navigation, LoadingScreen component
- **Behavior**: Show loading during auth check, redirect to SignIn if unauthenticated, render children if authenticated

### Frontend Route Protection Implementation
Navigation security architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]:
- **RootNavigator Updates**: Add auth state checking logic to determine initial route
- **Protected Wrapper**: Wrap MainTabs and Onboarding stacks with authentication guards
- **Navigation Flow**: Auth → (if not authenticated) → Onboarding → (if onboarding incomplete) → MainTabs
- **Loading States**: Show loading screen during auth state validation

### Backend Security Architecture
Row Level Security implementation [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
- **RLS Policies Already Defined**: All user data tables have auth.uid() filtering policies
- **Policy Patterns**: Direct user_id matching and EXISTS clause checking for related tables
- **Edge Function Security**: Auth validation middleware in backend-architecture.md shows token verification
- **Database Functions**: check_weekly_progress() and log_habit() functions use SECURITY DEFINER with proper auth

### API Security Layer
Service layer authentication [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- **Auth Middleware**: requireAuth() function validates JWT tokens in Edge Functions
- **User Context**: All service methods receive authenticated user ID
- **Repository Pattern**: GoalRepository and HabitLogRepository use user-scoped queries
- **Error Handling**: Consistent 401 Unauthorized responses for invalid auth

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create files at these exact paths [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Protected Route Component**: `app/src/navigation/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (new)
- **Root Navigator**: Update existing `app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`
- **Auth Hook**: Use existing `app/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- **Supabase Client**: Use existing `app/src/services/api/supabaseClient.ts`
- **Tests**: `app/src/navigation/__tests__/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx` (new)

### Critical Fullstack Security Rules
Essential security patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- **Type Sharing**: Use existing user and session types from shared/types
- **API Calls**: Use existing service layer with auth token headers, never bypass auth
- **Environment Variables**: Access through existing config objects for security
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error format for auth failures across frontend/backend
- **State Updates**: Use proper auth context patterns, never bypass auth state
- **Async Operations**: Always handle loading and error states for auth checks

### Database Row Level Security Details
Existing RLS implementation [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
```sql
-- Profiles: Users can only access their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Goals: Users can only access their own goals  
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own goals" ON goals FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Weekly Stages: Users can only access stages for their own goals
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own stages" ON weekly_stages FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM goals WHERE goals.id = weekly_stages.goal_id AND goals.user_id = auth.uid())
);

-- Habit Logs: Users can only access their own logs
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own logs" ON habit_logs FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Testing

**Security Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-rules]:
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for navigation components
- **Focus Area**: Critical security business logic - route access control and data isolation
- **Test Categories**: Authentication edge cases, unauthorized access attempts, RLS policy validation
- **Database Testing**: Test RLS policies directly in Supabase SQL editor
- **Component Testing**: Test ProtectedRoute component behavior with different auth states
- **5-10 Tests Maximum**: Focus on security vulnerabilities that could expose user data

# Epic 3 Details: Daily Habit Tracking & Weekly Progression

**Epic Goal:** Implement core binary tracking interface (Yes/No/Skip) with weekly stage advancement and progress visualization. Users can consistently log daily habits, see their progress throughout each week, automatically advance to new stages when successful, and maintain momentum through the visual feedback system that reinforces their journey toward their long-term goal.

## Story 3.1: Daily Habit Tracking Interface
As a user with an active roadmap,
I want to quickly log my daily habit completion with a simple binary choice,
so that I can maintain consistent tracking without friction or decision fatigue.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Clean daily dashboard showing current day's habit with large Yes/No/Skip buttons
2. Single-tap logging with immediate visual feedback and confirmation
3. Habit completion data stored locally (AsyncStorage) and synced to Supabase when online
4. Today's habit description and context pulled from current weekly stage
5. Visual indication of offline vs online sync status
6. Previous day review option if user missed logging yesterday
7. Habit completion timestamps recorded for analytics and progress tracking
8. Loading states handled gracefully during sync operations

## Story 3.2: Weekly Progress Visualization
As a user tracking daily habits,
I want to see my progress throughout the current week,
so that I can understand how close I am to completing this stage and stay motivated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Weekly calendar view showing completed, missed, and remaining days for current stage
2. Progress bar or visual indicator showing completion percentage (e.g., 4/7 days)
3. Encouraging messaging based on current progress ("Great momentum!" or "You're almost there!")
4. Clear display of weekly success criteria (e.g., "Complete 5 out of 7 days to advance")
5. Visual distinction between different completion states (Yes/No/Skip/Missed)
6. Week-over-week comparison showing consistency trends
7. Current stage title and brief description prominently displayed
8. Days remaining in current stage with countdown if approaching deadline

## Story 3.3: Weekly Stage Advancement System
As a user who has successfully completed a weekly stage,
I want to automatically advance to the next stage in my roadmap,
so that I can continue progressing toward my long-term goal without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automated stage advancement when weekly success criteria are met (default: 5/7 days)
2. Celebration screen acknowledging stage completion with specific achievement recognition
3. Preview of next week's stage showing new habits and objectives
4. Updated roadmap view reflecting completed stage and current position
5. Stage transition logged with timestamp for progress analytics
6. Option to delay stage advancement if user wants to repeat current week
7. Push notification celebrating stage completion (if notifications enabled)
8. Historical record of all completed stages accessible from profile

## Story 3.4: Progress Analytics & Motivation
As a user building habits over multiple weeks,
I want to see patterns in my consistency and overall progress,
so that I can understand my improvement and stay motivated during challenging periods.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Overall roadmap progress showing percentage completion toward long-term goal
2. Consistency metrics displaying average completion rate across all weeks
3. Streak tracking for consecutive successful days (but not prominently featured to avoid pressure)
4. Week-by-week completion rate comparison with trend visualization
5. Encouraging insights based on progress patterns ("You're strongest on weekdays" or "Consistency improving!")
6. Total days tracked and habits completed since starting journey
7. Estimated completion date for roadmap based on current pace
8. Option to share progress milestones (prepare for future social features)

## Story 3.5: Offline Habit Tracking & Sync
As a user who may not always have internet connectivity,
I want to log my habits offline and have them sync when I'm back online,
so that connectivity issues never prevent me from maintaining my habit tracking consistency.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Offline capability for daily habit logging using AsyncStorage local storage
2. Queue system storing offline actions for sync when connectivity returns
3. Visual indicators clearly showing offline mode vs online sync status
4. Automatic background sync when network connection is restored
5. Conflict resolution for edge cases where data exists both locally and remotely
6. Retry logic for failed sync attempts with exponential backoff
7. User notification when offline data has been successfully synced
8. Graceful handling of extended offline periods (multiple days)

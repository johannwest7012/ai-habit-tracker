## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6: Supabase Auth service successfully implemented with signIn method that handles authentication and session management. From Story 1.7: SignUpScreen component established patterns for form validation, error handling, and auth service integration that should be followed for consistency.

### Data Models
Login flow utilizes existing user authentication data structures [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]:
- **User Model**: Retrieved after successful authentication with UUID identifier
- **Session Data**: Supabase Auth manages session tokens and refresh tokens automatically
- **Profile Data**: User profile information loaded after successful authentication
- **Notification Preferences**: User preferences loaded for post-login app configuration

### Authentication Service Integration
Login will use existing authentication service [Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]:
- **signIn(email, password)**: Already implemented in Story 1.6, returns user session
- **Session Persistence**: Built into Supabase Auth configuration with AsyncStorage
- **Auth State Management**: Automatic session restoration on app launch
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ApiResponse format from existing auth service

### Component Specifications
**Login Screen Component** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]:
- **Location**: `app/src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx` (already exists, needs completion)
- **Dependencies**: useAuth hook, React Navigation, React Native Elements
- **State Management**: Form state with validation, auth loading states, remember me preference
- **Navigation Integration**: Part of AuthStack navigator configuration

### API Specifications
Email/password login uses Supabase Auth endpoints [Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]:
- **Endpoint**: Supabase Auth `/auth/v1/token` with grant_type=password
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and persistence via Supabase SDK
- **Remember Me**: Configured through Supabase Auth client settings
- **Row Level Security**: User data automatically accessible after authentication

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create/update files at these exact paths [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]:
- **Login Screen**: `app/src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx` (update existing)
- **Auth Stack Navigation**: Already configured in `app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`
- **Shared Types**: `shared/types/navigation.ts` (login screen already defined)
- **Tests**: `app/src/screens/auth/__tests__/LoginScreen.test.ts` (new)

### User Onboarding Workflow Integration
Login flow connects to established onboarding pattern [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#user-onboarding-goal-setup-workflow]:
1. User completes login form → calls Supabase Auth signIn
2. Auth service validates credentials and returns session
3. Navigation logic checks user.profile_data.onboarding_completed
4. If onboarding incomplete → redirect to onboarding welcome flow
5. If onboarding complete → redirect to main tabs (TodayScreen)

### UI Component Library Usage
Form components should use established design system [Source: architecture/components.md#ui-component-library]:
- **Form Elements**: React Native Elements Input components (consistent with SignUpScreen)
- **Loading States**: Existing LoadingSpinner component
- **Success/Error Messages**: Alert dialogs following established patterns from SignUpScreen
- **Remember Me**: React Native Elements CheckBox component

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.3+ required with proper form validation types [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **UI Framework**: React Native Elements 4.0+ for consistent Material Design [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local component state for form [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 with typed navigation params [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **Type Sharing**: Use existing navigation params from shared/types [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **API Calls**: Use existing auth service layer, never direct Supabase calls [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects via existing environment.ts [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Error Handling**: All login operations must return consistent error format [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate auth state directly - use proper auth context patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Async Operations**: Always handle loading and error states in login UI [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for UI components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Test Focus**: Minimal testing following "Test the Money, Not the Framework" philosophy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#core-philosophy-test-the-money-not-the-framework]
- **Test Organization**: Follow pattern `app/src/screens/auth/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-organization]
- **Login Testing**: Focus on form validation logic and error handling, avoid complex mocking of Supabase Auth [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-rules]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4: State management foundation established with React Query and comprehensive error handling patterns. Service layer integration with Supabase completed. All hooks follow TypeScript patterns with proper error handling that can be leveraged for centralized error reporting.

### Data Models
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for error tracking models. Will use standard error interface patterns and integrate with existing Supabase logging.

### API Specifications
Error handling will integrate with existing Supabase services [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]:
- **Supabase Logs**: Built-in centralized logging for Edge Functions and database [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Supabase Analytics**: Built-in usage analytics and basic monitoring for crash reporting [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Service Layer**: Use existing service layer pattern for error reporting API calls [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Component Specifications
**Error Boundary Architecture from Frontend Architecture:**
- **Component Location**: `app/src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx` [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
- **Error UI Components**: User-friendly error states following existing component patterns [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Layout Integration**: Error boundaries around navigation stacks in `app/src/navigation/` [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- **State Management**: Error state management using established Zustand patterns for UI state [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create files at these exact paths:
- **Error Boundary**: `app/src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Logging Service**: `app/src/services/logging/loggerService.ts` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Error Utilities**: `app/src/utils/errorHandling.ts` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Global Error Handlers**: Update `app/App.tsx` for global error setup [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Tests**: `app/src/components/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`, `app/src/services/__tests__/loggerService.test.ts` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for components and services [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Test Standards**: 70% unit tests, 30% integration tests for error scenarios [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]
- **Test Organization**: Follow pattern `app/src/components/__tests__/` and `app/src/services/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Error Testing**: Error boundary components must test error catching, fallback UI, and error reporting integration

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.3+ required for proper error type handling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **React Native**: Use React Native error handling patterns compatible with Expo SDK 50+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Logging Integration**: Must use Supabase Logs built-in logging, not third-party solutions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Monitoring**: Use Supabase Analytics for MVP, add Sentry post-launch [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **API Calls**: Error reporting must use service layer, never direct HTTP calls [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Error Handling**: All async operations must handle loading and error states in UI [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Environment Variables**: Access logging configuration only through config objects [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Type Sharing**: Define error types in shared/types and import from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate error state directly - use proper state management patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Service Layer Integration
Error handling must integrate with existing Supabase service [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]:
- **Supabase Client**: Use existing `app/src/services/api/supabase.ts` for error reporting
- **Auth Integration**: Include user context in error reports when authenticated
- **Consistent Format**: Match error format patterns established in React Query hooks
- **Network Errors**: Leverage existing React Query error handling patterns

### Error Boundary Configuration Requirements
- **Fallback UI**: User-friendly error screen with retry option and support contact
- **Error Context**: Capture component stack, user actions, and application state
- **Recovery**: Automatic recovery mechanisms where possible
- **Reporting**: Silent error reporting to logging service without user interruption
- **Development**: Detailed error information in development, sanitized in production

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts detected between epic requirements and project structure. Error handling components fit perfectly into established patterns. Supabase logging integration aligns with existing service architecture.

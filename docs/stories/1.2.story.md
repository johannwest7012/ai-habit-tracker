# Story 1.2: User Authentication System

## Status

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**: Foundation infrastructure is complete with Supabase client configured, React Query and Zustand state management ready, basic authStore exists, and navigation structure established. All dependencies for authentication are in place.

**Authentication Architecture** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]:
- JWT-based authentication using Supabase Auth
- Auth verification pattern: Extract JWT from Authorization header, verify with supabase.auth.getUser()
- User profile data stored in public.profiles table linked to auth.users
- Row Level Security policies ensure user data isolation

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
- Profiles table: `public.profiles` with id (UUID) referencing auth.users(id)
- Profile data includes: email, profile_data (JSON), subscription_tier, notification_preferences
- RLS policies: "Users can view own profile", "Users can update own profile"
- Profile creation should be automated via database trigger on auth.users INSERT

**Data Models** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]:
- User TypeScript interface with id, email, created_at, profile_data, subscription_tier, notification_preferences
- Profile data structure: `{ name?: string, avatar_url?: string, timezone: string, onboarding_completed: boolean }`
- Default notification preferences: `{ daily_reminder: true, reminder_time: "09:00", weekly_summary: true }`

**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Supabase Auth (Latest) for user authentication
- Built-in OAuth, magic links, Row Level Security integration
- React Query 5.0+ for auth state caching and management
- Zustand 4.4+ for local auth UI state

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Auth screens: `/app/src/screens/auth/`
- Auth store: `/app/src/stores/authStore.ts` (already exists)
- Auth service: `/app/src/services/` 
- Auth hook: `/app/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- Navigation: `/app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`
- Shared types: `/shared/types/models.ts`

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Components use PascalCase naming (e.g., `SignUpScreen.tsx`)
- Hooks use camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- Functions use camelCase (e.g., `signUp()`)
- Never make direct HTTP calls - use service layer
- Access environment variables only through config objects
- Always handle loading and error states in UI

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Organization**:
- Component tests in `app/src/screens/auth/__tests__/`
- Hook tests in `app/src/hooks/__tests__/`
- Service tests in `app/src/services/__tests__/`
- Store tests in `app/src/stores/__tests__/`

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests (70% of test pyramid) using Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Test file naming: `SignUpScreen.test.tsx` for components, `useAuth.test.ts` for hooks
- Use `@testing-library/react-native` for component testing
- Mock Supabase client and external dependencies
- Test auth flows, error states, and form validation

**Project Structure Notes**: All story requirements align with the defined unified project structure. Existing authStore and LoginScreen provide foundation to build upon. No structural conflicts identified.

## Detailed Analysis

### Requirements Traceability
- **AC1 (React Navigation v6 configured)**: ✓ PASS - Basic configuration exists
- **AC2 (Navigation types defined)**: ✗ FAIL - Types exist but don't match implementation
- **AC3 (Basic screen structure)**: ✓ PASS - Placeholder screens created
- **AC4 (Navigation state typed)**: ✗ FAIL - Type safety broken by untyped navigators

### Critical Findings

1. **Type Safety Breakdown**: The navigation implementation has completely broken TypeScript safety by using untyped nested navigators while defining typed parameter lists that don't match the actual structure.

2. **Architectural Deviation**: The implementation uses stack navigation for the main tabs instead of the specified tab navigation, creating poor UX and violating the architectural requirements.

3. **Missing Dependencies**: The required `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` package is not installed, preventing proper tab navigation implementation.

4. **Test Coverage Gap**: Tests only validate component rendering, not actual navigation functionality or type safety.

### Quality Impact

This implementation creates significant technical debt and violates fundamental requirements. The type safety issues pose runtime risks, and the architectural deviations create a poor user experience that doesn't match the design specifications.

### Recommendation

**FAIL** - Critical issues must be resolved before this story can be considered complete. The development team should address all high-severity issues before resubmitting for review.

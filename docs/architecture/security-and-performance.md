# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- Environment variables properly scoped with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Secure token storage using Expo SecureStore
- Input validation on all user inputs before API calls

**Backend Security:**
- Row Level Security policies enforce data isolation
- JWT token validation in all Edge Functions
- Rate limiting through Supabase built-in protections
- CORS policies configured for mobile app origins only

**Authentication Security:**
- JWT tokens stored securely on device
- Automatic token refresh through Supabase client
- Session timeout after 7 days of inactivity

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle size target: <10MB for mobile app
- Lazy loading for non-critical screens
- Image optimization through Expo image caching

**Backend Performance:**
- Response time target: <200ms for API calls, <2s for AI generation
- Database query optimization through proper indexing
- Edge Function cold start mitigation through keep-alive patterns

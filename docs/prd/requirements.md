# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall generate AI-powered roadmaps that transform user-inputted long-term goals into 8-12 week progressions with specific weekly stages and daily binary habits.

**FR2:** The daily tracking interface shall provide simple binary completion options (Yes/No/Skip) for each habit with single-tap logging capability.

**FR3:** The system shall automatically advance users to the next weekly stage when success criteria are met (configurable threshold, default 5/7 days completed).

**FR4:** The visual progress display shall show a linked-list roadmap view with completed stages, current stage, and upcoming stages including progress indicators.

**FR5:** The system shall provide basic recalibration by offering simplified alternatives when users fail to complete a weekly stage.

**FR6:** The goal setup wizard shall guide users through articulating their long-term goal and expected timeline during onboarding.

**FR7:** The system shall support user preview and editing of AI-generated roadmaps with simple explanations for each stage.

**FR8:** The system shall maintain offline capability for daily tracking with synchronization when connectivity is restored.

**FR9:** The system shall provide basic reminder notifications for daily habit completion (no advanced push notification features in MVP).

**FR10:** The system shall track user completion rates and progression statistics for each weekly stage.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** AI roadmap generation shall complete within 3 seconds of user goal submission.

**NFR2:** Daily habit logging shall respond within 1 second of user interaction.

**NFR3:** The system shall support iOS 14+ and Android 8+ for optimal performance.

**NFR4:** The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime for core tracking functionality.

**NFR5:** User data shall be encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols.

**NFR6:** The system shall handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

**NFR7:** The mobile application shall function offline for core tracking features with data synchronization upon reconnection.

**NFR8:** The system shall comply with GDPR requirements for user data privacy and deletion.

**NFR9:** API response times shall not exceed 2 seconds for all user-facing operations.

**NFR10:** The system shall integrate with OpenAI GPT-4 API for roadmap generation while respecting rate limits.

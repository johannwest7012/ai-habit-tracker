# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create an AI-guided habit tracking system that transforms user aspirations into structured, progressive weekly stages
- Achieve 60% 30-day retention rate by providing AI-generated roadmaps that reduce early user dropout  
- Enable users to complete major multi-week progressions (8+ weeks) with 40% goal achievement rate
- Deliver shame-free adaptability where the system adjusts to user pace rather than punishing missed days
- Build a complete habit-formation system that provides methodology alongside tracking mechanism

## Background Context

Traditional habit-tracking apps create a fundamental paradox: they require users to already possess expertise in habit formation to be effective, yet the users who need them most lack exactly that expertise. The core problem isn't motivationâ€”it's methodology. People abandon existing tools not due to lack of willpower, but because they're left alone to design their own progression plans and figure out the "how" of reaching their goals.

AI Habit Tracker addresses this expertise gap by combining simple binary daily tracking (Yes/No/Skip) with intelligent AI-generated roadmaps. Rather than requiring users to know what habits to track, the system transforms vague long-term goals into specific, achievable weekly milestones with clear daily actions. This creates a complete habit-formation system rather than just a logging tool, serving the underserved market of goal-oriented beginners who have motivation but lack structured implementation methodology.

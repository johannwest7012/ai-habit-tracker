# Epic 4 Details: Adaptive Recalibration & User Retention

**Epic Goal:** Provide recalibration flows when users struggle with weekly stages and implement retention mechanisms through notifications and encouragement. Users who fall behind or fail weekly stages receive adaptive support rather than abandonment, with the system adjusting their roadmap to meet them where they are while maintaining progress toward their long-term goal, ensuring sustainable habit formation rather than dropout.

## Story 4.1: Weekly Stage Failure Detection & Response

I want the system to recognize my struggle and offer supportive alternatives,
so that I can continue progressing without feeling like I've failed or need to start over.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automated detection when weekly stage success criteria are not met (e.g., completed less than 5/7 days)
2. Gentle messaging acknowledging the challenge without blame or judgment language
3. Analysis of user's actual completion pattern to understand specific struggles
4. Option to repeat current week with same habits or proceed to simplified alternative
5. Explanation of why recalibration helps rather than hinders long-term progress
6. User choice in recalibration approach - no forced changes to roadmap
7. Recalibration decision logged for future AI roadmap improvements
8. Encouragement messaging emphasizing learning and adaptation over perfection

## Story 4.2: AI-Powered Roadmap Recalibration

I want the system to generate a simplified but still progressive alternative path,
so that I can continue building toward my goal at a more sustainable pace.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Supabase Edge Function generating simplified alternatives based on user's completion patterns
2. Recalibrated roadmaps maintain logical progression toward original long-term goal
3. Simplified stages reduce daily habit complexity or frequency while preserving core benefits
4. New roadmap shows clear connection to original goal with adjusted timeline
5. User preview and approval process for recalibrated roadmap before implementation
6. Option to return to original roadmap later if circumstances improve
7. Recalibration reasoning explained to user (e.g., "Focusing on consistency over intensity")
8. Updated roadmap integrates seamlessly with existing progress tracking

## Story 4.3: Motivational Check-ins & Encouragement System
As a user progressing through my habit formation journey,
I want periodic encouragement and recognition of my efforts,
so that I stay motivated during difficult periods and feel supported by the system.

2. Weekly reflection prompts asking how the user is feeling about their progress
3. Milestone celebrations for significant achievements (first week completed, halfway point, etc.)

5. Tips and reminders sent at optimal times based on user's logging patterns
6. Gentle re-engagement for users who haven't logged habits in 2-3 days
7. Success pattern recognition with positive reinforcement ("You're strongest on Tuesdays!")
8. Option to adjust notification frequency and timing based on user preferences

## Story 4.4: Progress Recovery & Re-engagement Flow
As a user who has stopped using the app for several days,
I want a supportive way to restart my habit tracking without penalty,
so that temporary breaks don't permanently derail my long-term progress.

7. Success story sharing showing that breaks are normal and recoverable
8. Updated habit recommendations based on what might be more sustainable

## Story 4.5: Long-term Retention & Goal Evolution
As a user who has completed or significantly progressed through my roadmap,
I want options for continued engagement with habit formation,
so that I can build on my success and tackle new areas of growth.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Graduation celebration when users complete their full roadmap with achievement summary
2. Post-completion survey gathering feedback on roadmap effectiveness and user satisfaction

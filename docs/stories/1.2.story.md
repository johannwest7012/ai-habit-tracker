# Story 1.2: Supabase Client Integration

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** Supabase properly connected and configured,
**so that** I can build features that require backend data storage and authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Supabase client properly configured with environment variables
2. Connection testing verified with a simple health check
3. Environment configuration documented for development and production
4. Basic error handling for connection failures implemented

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up environment variables configuration (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create `.env.example` file with Supabase environment variables
  - [ ] Configure environment variable access through config objects per coding standards
  - [ ] Document environment setup for development and production
- [ ] Create Supabase client service (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Implement `app/src/services/api/supabaseClient.ts` with proper configuration
  - [ ] Add basic error handling for connection failures
  - [ ] Follow service layer pattern per coding standards
  - [ ] Use shared types from `shared/types` directory
- [ ] Implement connection health check (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create health check function to test Supabase connection
  - [ ] Add basic connectivity verification
  - [ ] Handle connection timeout scenarios
- [ ] Configure TypeScript types (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add Supabase client types to `shared/types/api.ts`
  - [ ] Ensure proper typing for client configuration
- [ ] Write unit tests (Testing Standards Compliance)
  - [ ] Create `app/src/services/__tests__/supabaseClient.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test client initialization and configuration
  - [ ] Test error handling for connection failures
  - [ ] Test health check functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Project foundation established with proper TypeScript configuration, folder structure in place, and testing framework configured. Environment variables must be handled through config objects per coding standards.

### Data Models
No specific data models needed for basic client setup. Connection configuration types will be defined in shared/types/api.ts [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### API Specifications
**Supabase Client Configuration:**
- Backend Framework: Supabase Edge Functions (Latest) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase) 15+ with ACID compliance and JSON support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- Authentication: Supabase Auth (Latest) with built-in OAuth and Row Level Security [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- API Style: REST + Realtime - HTTP APIs + WebSocket subscriptions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]

### Component Specifications
No UI components needed for this backend service story. Focus is on service layer implementation.

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create files at these exact paths:
- **Supabase Client**: `app/src/services/api/supabaseClient.ts` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Environment Config**: `.env.example` in project root
- **API Types**: `shared/types/api.ts` for Supabase client types [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Tests**: `app/src/services/__tests__/supabaseClient.test.ts` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for frontend services [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Test Standards**: 70% unit tests, 30% integration tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]
- **Test Organization**: Follow pattern `app/src/services/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Testing Requirements**: Service functions must have unit tests covering configuration, connection, and error scenarios

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.3+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Environment Variables**: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **API Calls**: Never make direct HTTP calls - use the service layer [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Error Handling**: All services must return consistent error format [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Naming Conventions
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `createSupabaseClient()`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Type Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `SupabaseConfig`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Files**: camelCase with descriptive names (e.g., `supabaseClient.ts`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **Type Sharing**: Always define types in shared/types and import from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Environment Variables**: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Error Handling**: All Edge Functions must return consistent error format [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts detected between epic requirements and defined project structure. All service locations align with unified project structure specification.

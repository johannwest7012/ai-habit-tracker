## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**: Story 1.1 successfully established the project foundation with Supabase client configuration, React Query setup, and navigation structure. The authentication system builds on this foundation with existing authStore.ts and navigation framework already in place.

**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Supabase Auth (Latest) for user authentication with built-in OAuth, magic links, and Row Level Security integration
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type-safe development throughout auth flows
- React Query 5.0+ already configured for server state management and auth API caching
- Zustand 4.4+ already configured via authStore.ts for client-side auth state
- React Navigation v6 already configured for protected route implementation

**User Data Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // Supabase Auth UUID
  email: string;
  created_at: Date;
  profile_data: {
    name?: string;
    avatar_url?: string;
    timezone: string;
    onboarding_completed: boolean;
  };
  subscription_tier: 'free' | 'premium';
  notification_preferences: {
    daily_reminder: boolean;
    reminder_time: string; // "09:00"
    weekly_summary: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Authentication Architecture** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Auth verification pattern: `const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser()`
- JWT tokens passed in Authorization header for Edge Function authentication
- Row Level Security policies ensure user data isolation automatically
- User profile creation on signup with default notification preferences

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Auth screens: `/app/src/screens/auth/` (LoginScreen.tsx, SignUpScreen.tsx, ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx)
- Auth hook: `/app/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- Auth service: `/app/src/services/authService.ts` 
- Auth store: `/app/src/stores/authStore.ts` (already exists from foundation)
- Navigation: `/app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` (update for auth flows)
- Types: `/shared/types/` for User and Auth interfaces

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Components use PascalCase naming (e.g., `LoginScreen.tsx`, `SignUpScreen.tsx`)
- Hooks use camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- Functions use camelCase (e.g., `signUp()`, `signIn()`, `signOut()`)
- Never make direct HTTP calls - use Supabase client through service layer
- Access environment variables only through config objects (already configured in foundation)
- Always handle loading and error states in auth UI components
- Use proper state management patterns with Zustand authStore

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Email verification required for account activation
- Password reset must use Supabase's secure email-based flow
- JWT tokens managed automatically by Supabase client
- Sensitive data (tokens) stored using Expo SecureStore only
- Row Level Security policies configured for automatic user data isolation

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Organization**:
- Auth hook tests in `app/src/hooks/__tests__/useAuth.test.ts`
- Screen component tests in `app/src/screens/auth/__tests__/`
- Service tests in `app/src/services/__tests__/authService.test.ts`
- Use Jest + React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Mock Supabase client and SecureStore for isolated testing

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test auth state transitions (logged out → signing up → logged in)
- Test form validation on login/signup screens
- Test error handling for network failures and invalid credentials
- Test protected route behavior with authenticated/unauthenticated states
- Test auth state persistence across app restarts

**Project Structure Notes**: All auth-related files align with the unified project structure. Auth screens go in `/app/src/screens/auth/`, hooks in `/app/src/hooks/`, and services in `/app/src/services/`. The existing authStore.ts provides the foundation for auth state management.

notes: |
  Exceptional implementation demonstrating senior-level engineering practices. The LoginScreen 
  component shows comprehensive functionality with robust error handling, proper validation, 
  and seamless integration with existing architecture. Test coverage is thorough and follows 
  established patterns. Code quality is production-ready with excellent maintainability.
  
  This story represents a model implementation that other authentication features should follow.
  The remember me functionality is particularly well-implemented with proper AsyncStorage 
  integration and user preference handling.

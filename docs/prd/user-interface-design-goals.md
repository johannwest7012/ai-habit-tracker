# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The interface should embody simplicity and emotional engagement, creating a sense of progress and achievement through minimalist design. Every interaction should feel intentional and rewarding, with the primary focus on the daily Yes/No decision that drives habit formation.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Binary Simplicity:** All user inputs are Yes/No/Skip - no complex forms, sliders, or lengthy inputs
- **Celebratory Feedback:** Success moments are amplified with animation, sound, and visual celebration
- **Timeline Navigation:** Journey progress is visualized as a forward-moving timeline, never looking backward
- **Adaptive Guidance:** Interface adjusts based on user success patterns, offering encouragement or replanning options

## Core Screens and Views
- **Journey Creation Screen:** Chat-like interface for goal input and AI clarification
- **Daily Habit Screen:** Central hub with current habit prompt and Yes/No/Skip buttons
- **Weekly Summary Screen:** Progress visualization with level-up prompts
- **Roadmap Timeline View:** Visual journey showing past, current, and future stages
- **Replan Interface:** Gentle failure recovery with AI-assisted journey modification

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure compatibility with screen readers, sufficient color contrast ratios, and alternative text for all visual elements. Support dynamic text sizing and maintain functionality across assistive technologies.

## Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic with encouraging color palette (greens for success, soft blues for progress, warm oranges for celebration). Typography should feel approachable yet confident, supporting the app's role as a gentle but persistent habit coach.

## Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Only
Optimized specifically for iOS and Android smartphones with portrait-first design. All interactions designed for thumb-friendly navigation and single-handed use during daily check-ins.

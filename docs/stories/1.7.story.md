## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6: Supabase Auth service successfully implemented with signUp, signIn, signOut methods and comprehensive authentication state management. The signUp method already includes profile creation and email verification, so this story focuses on the UI layer integration with existing auth infrastructure.

### Data Models
User registration will create these data structures [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]:
- **User Model**: Created automatically by Supabase Auth with UUID identifier
- **Profile Data**: JSON object containing name, avatar_url, timezone, onboarding_completed (initially false)
- **Subscription Tier**: Defaults to 'free' tier for new users
- **Notification Preferences**: Default notification settings (daily_reminder: true, reminder_time: "09:00", weekly_summary: true)

### Authentication Service Integration
Registration will use existing authentication service [Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]:
- **signUp(email, password)**: Already implemented in Story 1.6, includes profile creation
- **Email Verification**: Built into Supabase Auth configuration
- **Session Management**: Automatic token storage and auth state persistence
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ApiResponse format from existing auth service

### Component Specifications
**SignUp Screen Component** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]:
- **Location**: `app/src/screens/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx`
- **Dependencies**: useAuth hook, React Navigation, React Native Elements
- **State Management**: Form state with validation, auth loading states
- **Navigation Integration**: Part of AuthStack navigator configuration

### API Specifications
Email/password registration uses Supabase Auth endpoints [Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]:
- **Endpoint**: Supabase Auth `/auth/v1/signup`
- **Email Verification**: Automatic email sent via configured Supabase Auth
- **Profile Creation**: Handled by existing signUp method implementation
- **Row Level Security**: User data automatically isolated by Supabase Auth policies

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create/update files at these exact paths [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]:
- **Signup Screen**: `app/src/screens/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx` (new)
- **Auth Stack Navigation**: `app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` (update existing)
- **Shared Types**: `shared/types/navigation.ts` (update for new screen)
- **Tests**: `app/src/screens/auth/__tests__/SignUpScreen.test.ts` (new)

### User Onboarding Workflow Integration
Registration flow follows established onboarding pattern [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#user-onboarding-goal-setup-workflow]:
1. User completes signup form → calls Supabase Auth
2. Auth creates user record and sends verification email
3. User profile created with default settings
4. Navigation to email verification instruction screen
5. After verification, redirect to onboarding welcome flow

### UI Component Library Usage
Form components should use established design system [Source: architecture/components.md#ui-component-library]:
- **Form Elements**: React Native Elements Input components
- **Styling**: NativeWind utility classes for consistent design
- **Loading States**: Existing LoadingSpinner component
- **Success/Error Messages**: Consistent messaging patterns from error handling strategy

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.3+ required with proper form validation types [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **UI Framework**: React Native Elements 4.0+ for consistent Material Design [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local component state for form [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 with typed navigation params [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **Type Sharing**: Define navigation params in shared/types and import from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **API Calls**: Use existing auth service layer, never direct Supabase calls [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects via existing environment.ts [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Error Handling**: All registration operations must return consistent error format [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate auth state directly - use proper auth context patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Async Operations**: Always handle loading and error states in registration UI [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for UI components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Test Focus**: Minimal testing following "Test the Money, Not the Framework" philosophy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#core-philosophy-test-the-money-not-the-framework]
- **Test Organization**: Follow pattern `app/src/screens/auth/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-organization]
- **Registration Testing**: Focus on form validation logic and error handling, avoid complex mocking of Supabase Auth [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-rules]

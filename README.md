## AI Habit Tracker

### 📝 Project Summary

A universal habit-building app that helps users achieve long-term goals through simple binary daily tracking and weekly progression. The AI converts user-defined aspirations into structured roadmaps, where each stage defines a weekly goal achieved through daily Yes/No tasks. With minimal tracking friction and consistent reinforcement, users gradually build momentum and advance through their journey.

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Most habit-tracking tools require users to already know what habits to track — they offer a UI, not a roadmap. But in reality, nearly every habit is a means to a long-term goal, whether consciously stated or not. You don't drink more water for the sake of it — you do it to become healthier. You don't practice guitar for 15 minutes daily without a bigger intention — you do it to improve.

The challenge is that people often *want* to reach a goal, but they don’t know the steps to get there. That uncertainty leads to friction, indecision, and eventually, dropout.

Whether the goal is fitness, creativity, learning, or self-discipline, users are left alone to figure out the “how.” Traditional habit apps put the burden on the user to design a progression. This app solves that — by combining tracking **and** structured guidance — helping users translate long-term ambitions into simple, daily actions, and advancing them automatically when they're ready.

### 🎯 Target Users

The app is designed for anyone with a meaningful goal they want to achieve over time — especially those who struggle to translate that goal into consistent daily habits.

Key user profiles include:

* **Goal-Oriented Individuals** who crave structure and accountability without complexity
* **Beginners** starting a new journey (e.g., fitness, skill-building, self-improvement)
* **Overwhelmed Users** who are tired of complex productivity tools and want a low-friction experience
* **People in Transition** seeking to build momentum in a new phase of life (career, health, lifestyle)

The system is deliberately goal-agnostic, making it suitable for a wide range of users — from a student learning a language to a professional preparing for an interview.

### 🧱 Core Features & Functionality

**1. AI-Generated Roadmap**
Users describe their long-term goal, and the AI breaks it into a weekly progression of achievable stages, each tied to simple daily binary habits.

**2. Daily Yes/No Habit Tracking**
Each day, users log whether they completed the task with a single tap — “Yes”, “No”, or “Skip” — minimizing friction and encouraging consistency.

**3. Weekly Aggregation & Level-Up**
The app rolls up daily check-ins into weekly evaluations. When success criteria are met, users level up to the next stage of their journey.

**4. Visual Roadmap Screen**
A linked-list-style view of weekly stages shows users where they are, where they’ve been, and what’s coming next.

**5. Progress Feedback**
Celebratory micro-interactions (e.g. confetti, affirmations) reinforce positive momentum. Users see visual progress week by week.

**6. Recalibration & Flexibility**
If users struggle, the AI can replan upcoming stages to keep the journey alive without guilt or shame.

**7. Transparent AI Planning**
Users can preview and optionally edit their journey roadmap, with simple language explanations of why certain habits or targets were chosen.

### 🧭 Differentiation

Unlike typical habit trackers that simply log what users decide to track, this app helps users **decide what to track in the first place.** It acts as both a guide and a tracker, using AI to transform vague goals into structured progressions.

What makes it different:

* **Goal-Agnostic Simplicity**: Supports any kind of goal, from fitness to creativity to productivity, using a single binary interface.
* **Built-In Guidance**: AI creates the path — users don’t have to design their own plan or guess what to do next.
* **Progressive Structure**: Weekly level-ups make the experience feel like a game, not a chore.
* **Low Friction, High Intent**: One-tap check-ins and clear visual feedback keep users engaged without overwhelming them.
* **Shame-Free Adaptability**: If users fall behind, the system adjusts — no punishment, just progression at their pace.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6: Supabase Auth service successfully implemented with comprehensive auth methods including resetPasswordForEmail. From Story 1.7 & 1.8: Auth screen patterns established for form validation, error handling, and consistent UI styling using React Native Elements. LoginScreen component ready for "Forgot Password?" link integration.

### Data Models
Password reset utilizes existing user authentication data structures [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]:
- **User Model**: Password reset targets existing user records by email
- **Session Data**: Supabase Auth manages reset tokens automatically
- **Email Verification**: Reset flow sends secure email with reset link
- **Profile Data**: User profile remains unchanged during reset process

### Authentication Service Integration
Password reset uses existing authentication service [Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]:
- **resetPasswordForEmail(email)**: Supabase Auth method for password reset
- **Session Management**: Reset invalidates existing sessions for security
- **Email Templates**: Supabase Auth provides built-in reset email templates
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ApiResponse format from existing auth service

### Component Specifications
**Password Reset Screen Component** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]:
- **Location**: `app/src/screens/auth/PasswordResetScreen.tsx` (new file)
- **Dependencies**: useAuth hook, React Navigation, React Native Elements
- **State Management**: Form state with validation, loading states, success confirmation
- **Navigation Integration**: Part of AuthStack navigator configuration

### API Specifications
Password reset uses Supabase Auth endpoints [Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]:
- **Endpoint**: Supabase Auth `/auth/v1/recover` for password reset requests
- **Email Delivery**: Automatic email sending via Supabase Auth service
- **Security**: Rate limiting and validation built into Supabase Auth
- **Success Response**: Returns confirmation without revealing user existence

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create files at these exact paths [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]:
- **Password Reset Screen**: `app/src/screens/auth/PasswordResetScreen.tsx` (new)
- **Password Reset Confirmation Screen**: `app/src/screens/auth/PasswordResetConfirmationScreen.tsx` (new)
- **Auth Stack Navigation**: Update existing `app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`
- **Shared Types**: Update `shared/types/navigation.ts` (add new screen types)
- **Tests**: `app/src/screens/auth/__tests__/PasswordResetScreen.test.tsx` (new)

### User Authentication Workflow Integration
Password reset flow connects to established auth patterns [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#user-onboarding-goal-setup-workflow]:
1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login screen → navigates to PasswordResetScreen
2. User enters email → calls Supabase Auth resetPasswordForEmail
3. Auth service sends reset email with secure token → shows confirmation screen
4. User receives email and follows link → handled by Supabase Auth automatically
5. User completes password reset in email flow → returns to app login screen

### UI Component Library Usage
Form components should use established design system [Source: architecture/components.md#ui-component-library]:
- **Form Elements**: React Native Elements Input components (consistent with LoginScreen/SignUpScreen)
- **Loading States**: Existing LoadingSpinner component patterns
- **Success/Error Messages**: Alert dialogs following established patterns
- **Navigation Elements**: React Native Elements Button components for actions

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.3+ required with proper form validation types [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **UI Framework**: React Native Elements 4.0+ for consistent Material Design [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **State Management**: Local component state for form, no global state needed [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 with typed navigation params [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **Type Sharing**: Use existing navigation params from shared/types [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **API Calls**: Use existing auth service layer, never direct Supabase calls [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects via existing environment.ts [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Error Handling**: All reset operations must return consistent error format [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate auth state directly - use proper auth context patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Async Operations**: Always handle loading and error states in reset UI [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for UI components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Test Focus**: Minimal testing following "Test the Money, Not the Framework" philosophy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#core-philosophy-test-the-money-not-the-framework]
- **Test Organization**: Follow pattern `app/src/screens/auth/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-organization]
- **Password Reset Testing**: Focus on email validation logic and error handling, avoid complex mocking of Supabase Auth [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-rules]
- **5-10 Tests Maximum**: Only test business logic that could cause user-blocking failures [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-rules]

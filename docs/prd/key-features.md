# ðŸ§© Key Features (MVP Scope)

**1. AI Goal Breakdown Engine**
Users enter a long-term goal via chat. The AI asks follow-up questions, then generates a weekly roadmap with progressive daily Yes/No tasks.

**2. Daily Tracking UI**
Minimalist screen with daily habit prompt and Yes/No/Skip buttons. Includes celebratory feedback (e.g. confetti, sound) on success.

**3. Weekly Progress Screen**
Summarizes user's progress for the week, checks if success criteria are met (e.g., "3 Yes out of 5 target"), and offers promotion to next stage.

**4. Roadmap View**
Linked-list style display of all stages. Highlights current week, allows looking ahead or reflecting on past weeks.

**5. Progression Logic Engine**
Handles level-up logic (e.g., 2 successful weeks in a row), recalculates progression if needed, and prevents demotion in MVP.

**6. AI Replan Option**
If users fail consistently, a "Replan Journey" feature lets the AI offer a gentler, revised path forward.

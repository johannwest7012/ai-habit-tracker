### API Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for this foundation setup story.

### Component Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for this foundation setup story.

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create the following exact paths:
- **App Structure**: `app/src/` as main source directory [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Components**: `app/src/components/` with subdirectories:
  - `common/` - Shared components
  - `habit/` - Habit tracking components  
  - `goal/` - Goal management components
  - `layout/` - Layout components
- **Screens**: `app/src/screens/` with subdirectories:
  - `auth/` - Authentication screens
  - `main/` - Main app screens
  - `onboarding/` - Onboarding flow
- **Services**: `app/src/services/` with subdirectories:
  - `api/` - Supabase client
  - `storage/` - Offline storage
  - `sync/` - Sync management
- **State Management**: `app/src/stores/` for Zustand stores
- **Hooks**: `app/src/hooks/` for custom React hooks
- **Navigation**: `app/src/navigation/` for navigation configuration
- **Utilities**: `app/src/utils/` and `app/src/constants/`
- **Shared Types**: `shared/types/` with `models.ts`, `api.ts`, `index.ts`
- **Configuration Files**: `app/tsconfig.json`, `app/app.json`, `app/babel.config.js`, `app/tailwind.config.js`
- **Root Config**: `tsconfig.base.json` in project root

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.3+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Expo SDK**: 50+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Build Tool**: Must use Expo CLI + EAS Build [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Bundler**: Metro bundler (default React Native bundler) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `HabitCard.tsx`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Hooks**: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions] 
- **Type Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `WeeklyStage`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Functions**: camelCase [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **Type Sharing**: Always define types in shared/types and import from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Environment Variables**: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Async Operations**: Always handle loading and error states in UI [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test File Location**: Follow pattern `app/src/components/__tests__/`, `app/src/hooks/__tests__/`, `app/src/services/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Test Frameworks**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for frontend [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Test Standards**: 70% unit tests, 30% integration tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]
- **Testing Requirements**: All components must have basic render tests, service functions must have unit tests

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts detected between epic requirements and defined project structure. All folder structures align with unified project structure specification.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation quality is **GOOD** with solid foundation work. The Expo React Native project is properly configured with TypeScript, follows architectural guidelines, and has a well-structured codebase. All acceptance criteria have been fully implemented.

### Refactoring Performed

Critical testing configuration issues were identified and resolved:

- **File**: `app/babel.config.js`
  - **Change**: Created missing Babel configuration file with expo preset
  - **Why**: Jest tests were failing due to missing Babel configuration required for React Native compilation
  - **How**: Added standard expo preset configuration to enable proper JavaScript transformation

- **File**: `app/src/__tests__/setup.ts`
  - **Change**: Simplified test setup by removing problematic mocks and global declarations
  - **Why**: React Native Reanimated and global __DEV__ mocks were causing test failures due to missing dependencies
  - **How**: Streamlined to minimal Jest Native Testing Library setup only

- **File**: `app/jest.config.js`  
  - **Change**: Updated testMatch patterns and transformIgnorePatterns
  - **Why**: Setup file was incorrectly treated as a test file, and expo modules weren't being transformed
  - **How**: Fixed pattern matching to exclude setup files and included expo-status-bar in transform patterns

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier properly configured per coding-standards.md
- Project Structure: ✓ Directory structure exactly matches unified-project-structure.md specifications  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Jest + React Native Testing Library setup per testing-strategy.md
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

All critical issues were addressed during review:

- [x] Fixed missing Babel configuration (app/babel.config.js) 
- [x] Resolved Jest test setup issues (app/src/__tests__/setup.ts)
- [x] Fixed Jest transformIgnorePatterns for expo modules (app/jest.config.js)
- [x] Validated all tests pass (1/1 tests passing)
- [x] Confirmed TypeScript compilation successful

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. This is foundational project setup with no sensitive functionality implemented yet.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues identified. Configuration is optimized with appropriate path aliases and proper TypeScript settings.

### Files Modified During Review

- `app/babel.config.js` (created)
- `app/src/__tests__/setup.ts` (modified)
- `app/jest.config.js` (modified)

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-basic-expo-project-setup.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, tests passing, TypeScript compiles successfully, and critical configuration issues resolved.

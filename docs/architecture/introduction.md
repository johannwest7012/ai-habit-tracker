# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **AI Habit Tracker**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project built with:
- **Expo managed workflow** for the mobile application
- **Supabase** as the Backend-as-a-Service platform
- **Monorepo structure** for the codebase organization

While not using a specific starter template, we leverage:
- Expo's TypeScript template for the initial project setup
- Supabase's React Native quickstart for authentication patterns
- React Query's Expo examples for state management patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Supabase client and environment configuration properly established. TypeScript types are defined in shared/types directory. Service layer pattern and error handling implemented successfully.

### Data Models
No specific data models needed for navigation setup. Navigation types will be defined in shared/types/navigation.ts [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### API Specifications
No API integrations required for basic navigation framework setup.

### Component Specifications
**Navigation Architecture from Frontend Architecture:**
- **Route Organization**: RootNavigator with AuthStack, OnboardingStack, and MainTabs structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- **Stack Navigation**: Use @react-navigation/native-stack for main navigation structure
- **Protected Routes**: ProtectedRoute pattern for authenticated access (to be implemented in later story)
- **Tab Navigation**: MainTabs with TodayStack, ProgressStack, JourneyStack, ProfileStack [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create files at these exact paths:
- **Root Navigator**: `app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Navigation Types**: `shared/types/navigation.ts` for navigation type definitions [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Auth Screens**: `app/src/screens/auth/SignInScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Onboarding Screens**: `app/src/screens/onboarding/WelcomeScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/onboarding/GoalSetupScreen.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Main Screens**: `app/src/screens/main/TodayScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/main/ProgressScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/main/JourneyScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/main/ProfileScreen.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Tests**: `app/src/navigation/__tests__/RootNavigator.test.tsx` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for frontend components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Test Standards**: 70% unit tests, 30% integration tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]
- **Test Organization**: Follow pattern `app/src/navigation/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Testing Requirements**: Navigation components must have unit tests covering screen rendering, navigation flow, and TypeScript type safety

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.3+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **React Navigation**: v6 with native stack navigator [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- **Type Sharing**: Always define types in shared/types and import from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Component Organization**: Follow established folder structure for screens [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `RootNavigator`, `SignInScreen`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Type Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `AuthStackParamList`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Files**: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `RootNavigator.tsx`, `SignInScreen.tsx`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **Type Sharing**: Always define types in shared/types and import from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Async Operations**: Always handle loading and error states in UI [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts detected between epic requirements and defined project structure. All navigation locations align with unified project structure specification.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**: The navigation implementation has fundamental type safety and architectural problems that must be addressed before proceeding. While the basic structure exists, the implementation deviates significantly from the planned architecture and introduces type safety violations.

**Primary Concerns:**
1. **Broken Type Safety**: Navigation types don't match implementation structure
2. **Architectural Mismatch**: Missing tab navigation, incorrect nesting structure
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Required tab navigation packages not installed
4. **Incomplete Implementation**: MainTabs using stack instead of tab navigator

### Refactoring Performed

**NONE** - As QA agent, I cannot modify implementation files. All issues must be addressed by the development team.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✗ Type sharing violated - navigation types don't match implementation
- **Project Structure**: ✗ File locations correct but architecture doesn't match specs
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Tests exist but don't validate actual navigation functionality
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ AC2 (proper TypeScript support) and AC4 (typed navigation state) not fully met

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix

**HIGH SEVERITY - BLOCKING ISSUES:**

1. **Type Safety Violations**
   - **File**: [`app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`](app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx:55-89)
   - **Issue**: Nested navigators (AuthNavigator, OnboardingNavigator, MainTabsNavigator) are untyped
   - **Impact**: Runtime navigation errors, loss of TypeScript safety
   - **Required**: Properly type all nested navigators with correct param lists

2. **Architecture Deviation**
   - **File**: [`app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`](app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx:78-89)
   - **Issue**: MainTabsNavigator uses stack instead of tab navigation
   - **Impact**: Incorrect UX, doesn't match design specifications
   - **Required**: Implement proper tab navigation with [`@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`](app/package.json)

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   - **File**: [`app/package.json`](app/package.json:19-28)
   - **Issue**: Missing `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` for tab navigation
   - **Impact**: Cannot implement proper tab-based main navigation
   - **Required**: Install missing navigation dependencies

4. **Type Definition Mismatch**
   - **File**: [`shared/types/navigation.ts`](shared/types/navigation.ts:23-46)
   - **Issue**: Type definitions assume tab structure but implementation uses stacks
   - **Impact**: Type safety completely broken between types and implementation
   - **Required**: Align types with actual navigation structure or fix implementation

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Fix type safety for all nested navigators
- [ ] Install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs dependency
- [ ] Implement proper tab navigation for MainTabs
- [ ] Align navigation types with actual implementation structure
- [ ] Add typed navigation props to screen components
- [ ] Enhance tests to validate actual navigation behavior (not just rendering)
- [ ] Add integration tests for navigation flows
- [ ] Add error boundary handling for navigation failures

### Security Review

**LOW RISK**: Navigation framework itself doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities. However, proper type safety is essential for preventing runtime errors that could lead to app crashes.

### Performance Considerations

**MEDIUM CONCERN**: Current stack-based approach for main navigation will create unnecessary navigation stack depth. Tab navigation would provide better performance and UX.

### Files Modified During Review

**NONE** - QA agent cannot modify implementation files.

**DEVELOPMENT TEAM ACTION REQUIRED**: All critical issues above must be addressed before story can be marked as Done.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → [`docs/qa/gates/1.3-navigation-framework-setup.yml`](docs/qa/gates/1.3-navigation-framework-setup.yml)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical type safety and architecture issues must be resolved**

**BLOCKING ISSUES**: Type safety violations and architectural deviations prevent this story from meeting acceptance criteria. The implementation needs significant rework to match the planned navigation architecture and restore TypeScript safety.

**NEXT STEPS**: Development team must address all high-severity issues above before re-submitting for review.

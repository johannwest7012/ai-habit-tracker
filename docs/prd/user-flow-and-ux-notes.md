**Primary Flow:**

   * AI asks brief clarifying questions.
   * Roadmap is generated and user accepts or edits it.

2. **Daily Habit Screen**

   * Each day shows the current habit.
   * User taps Yes/No/Skip.
   * Feedback animation appears on Yes.

3. **Weekly Summary**

   * Every Sunday, user sees weekly results.
   * If success criteria met, user is prompted to level up.
   * If not, user repeats or chooses to replan.

4. **Roadmap View**

   * Accessible anytime.
   * Shows all past, current, and future weeks in roadmap format.

**UX Notes:**

* Binary interactions only (no sliders, ratings, or logs).
* Copy and visuals should reinforce effort over perfection.
* Celebrations should feel meaningful but not gimmicky.
* All failure states should include soft landing and encouragement.

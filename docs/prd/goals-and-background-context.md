# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Provide a frictionless daily habit tracker that works across any goal category
- Help users transform long-term ambitions into achievable daily actions  
- Leverage AI to reduce decision fatigue and create adaptive, personalized habit journeys
- Encourage consistency and reduce abandonment through clear progression and feedback
- Validate product-market fit with early user behavior and feedback

## Background Context
AI Habit Tracker addresses the common problem of goal abandonment by transforming vague long-term aspirations into concrete, manageable daily actions. Unlike generic habit trackers that require users to figure out their own progression, this app uses AI to create personalized roadmaps that adapt based on user success patterns. The current market lacks solutions that combine the simplicity of binary tracking (Yes/No/Skip) with intelligent, adaptive progression systems that prevent users from feeling overwhelmed or giving up when they struggle.

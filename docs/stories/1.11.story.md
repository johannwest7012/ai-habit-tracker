## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.6-1.10: Authentication system fully implemented with useAuth hook, navigation structure established with AuthStack, OnboardingStack, and MainTabs. Route protection implemented with ProtectedRoute component. Auth context provides global user state. Now ready to build onboarding flow starting with welcome screen.

### Component Architecture
Welcome screen follows established patterns [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]:
- **Screen Location**: `app/src/screens/onboarding/WelcomeScreen.tsx` - part of onboarding flow
- **Component Pattern**: Functional component with TypeScript, uses memo for performance
- **Hooks Integration**: Uses navigation hooks for routing, can access auth state if needed
- **Styling Approach**: NativeWind utility classes for consistent design system

### Navigation Integration
Welcome screen integration with navigation system [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]:
- **Route Structure**: Part of OnboardingStack within RootNavigator
- **Navigation Flow**: AuthStack → OnboardingStack (WelcomeScreen) → MainTabs
- **Entry Point**: First screen new users see after authentication or when not authenticated
- **Navigation Props**: Receives navigation prop for programmatic navigation to next screens

### UI Component Library Integration
Reusable components for consistent design [Source: architecture/components.md#ui-component-library]:
- **Button Components**: Use consistent button styling from component library
- **Typography**: Consistent text styling and hierarchy across app
- **Layout Components**: Header and spacing components for consistent layout
- **Brand Elements**: Logo/icon components that establish visual identity

### User Onboarding Workflow Context
Welcome screen as entry point to goal setup [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#user-onboarding-goal-setup-workflow]:
- **Flow Position**: First screen in onboarding after auth, introduces app concept
- **User Journey**: Welcome → Goal Description → Timeline → Confirmation → AI Roadmap
- **Value Communication**: Must clearly explain AI-guided habit formation before goal setup
- **Conversion Goal**: Encourage users to continue to goal articulation wizard

### Brand Messaging and Value Proposition
Key messaging elements based on product positioning:
- **Primary Hook**: "AI-guided habit formation" - distinguishes from traditional trackers
- **Core Value**: Guidance over tracking - app adapts to user struggles vs rigid tracking
- **Shame-Free Approach**: Emphasize adaptation and recalibration vs failure mentality
- **Progressive Method**: Weekly stages that build gradually toward long-term goals

### Technology Stack Implementation
Frontend tech stack integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **React Native + Expo**: SDK 50+ with managed workflow for cross-platform
- **TypeScript**: Proper interface definitions for props and navigation
- **NativeWind**: Utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS classes for React Native
- **React Navigation**: Stack navigation within OnboardingStack

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Welcome Screen Component**: `app/src/screens/onboarding/WelcomeScreen.tsx` (new)
- **Navigation Integration**: Update existing `app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`
- **Shared Types**: Use existing navigation types from `shared/types/navigation.ts`
- **Tests**: `app/src/screens/onboarding/__tests__/WelcomeScreen.test.tsx` (new, minimal)

### Critical Fullstack Standards
Implementation requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- **Type Sharing**: Use navigation types from shared/types for navigation props
- **Component Naming**: PascalCase for WelcomeScreen.tsx
- **Function Naming**: camelCase for event handlers and internal functions
- **State Management**: Local component state only, no global state needed for this screen
- **Async Operations**: Handle loading states if any async operations needed

### Visual Design Requirements
Calming, growth-focused brand aesthetic elements:
- **Color Palette**: Soft, natural colors suggesting growth and calm (greens, blues, warm neutrals)
- **Typography**: Friendly, readable fonts that convey approachability and competence
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace creating calm, uncluttered feel
- **Visual Elements**: Subtle graphics or icons suggesting growth, journey, or guidance

### Copy and Messaging Strategy
Content approach emphasizing guidance over tracking:
- **Headline**: Clear statement about AI-guided approach to habit formation
- **Subheading**: Explanation of how this differs from traditional habit trackers
- **Body Copy**: Brief description of adaptive, shame-free approach to building habits
- **Call-to-Action**: Encouraging button text that invites users to begin their journey

### Testing Strategy
Minimal testing approach [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-rules]:
- **Component Rendering**: Basic test that screen renders without crashing
- **Navigation Function**: Test that CTA button triggers proper navigation
- **Content Display**: Verify key messaging elements are displayed
- **Responsive Design**: Manual testing on iOS/Android via Expo Go
- **No Complex Testing**: Avoid mocking navigation or testing detailed UI interactions

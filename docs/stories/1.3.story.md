## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Supabase client and environment configuration properly established. TypeScript types are defined in shared/types directory. Service layer pattern and error handling implemented successfully.

### Data Models
No specific data models needed for navigation setup. Navigation types will be defined in shared/types/navigation.ts [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### API Specifications
No API integrations required for basic navigation framework setup.

### Component Specifications
**Navigation Architecture from Frontend Architecture:**
- **Route Organization**: RootNavigator with AuthStack, OnboardingStack, and MainTabs structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- **Stack Navigation**: Use @react-navigation/native-stack for main navigation structure
- **Protected Routes**: ProtectedRoute pattern for authenticated access (to be implemented in later story)
- **Tab Navigation**: MainTabs with TodayStack, ProgressStack, JourneyStack, ProfileStack [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure, create files at these exact paths:
- **Root Navigator**: `app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Navigation Types**: `shared/types/navigation.ts` for navigation type definitions [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Auth Screens**: `app/src/screens/auth/SignInScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Onboarding Screens**: `app/src/screens/onboarding/WelcomeScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/onboarding/GoalSetupScreen.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Main Screens**: `app/src/screens/main/TodayScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/main/ProgressScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/main/JourneyScreen.tsx`, `app/src/screens/main/ProfileScreen.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Tests**: `app/src/navigation/__tests__/RootNavigator.test.tsx` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for frontend components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **Test Standards**: 70% unit tests, 30% integration tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]
- **Test Organization**: Follow pattern `app/src/navigation/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Testing Requirements**: Navigation components must have unit tests covering screen rendering, navigation flow, and TypeScript type safety

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.3+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- **React Navigation**: v6 with native stack navigator [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- **Type Sharing**: Always define types in shared/types and import from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Component Organization**: Follow established folder structure for screens [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `RootNavigator`, `SignInScreen`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Type Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `AuthStackParamList`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Files**: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `RootNavigator.tsx`, `SignInScreen.tsx`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **Type Sharing**: Always define types in shared/types and import from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Async Operations**: Always handle loading and error states in UI [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts detected between epic requirements and defined project structure. All navigation locations align with unified project structure specification.
